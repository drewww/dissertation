\chapter{Conclusion}

A major challenge with a design oriented approach is identifying the contributions that come from the work as a whole. On a per project basis it's easier to demonstrate the achievements and failings of a particular design strategy. But what can we learn from assembling a set of projects in a design space that extends beyond the outcomes of each individual project?

One way to think about this design oriented approach is to consider this thesis a kind of map of the broader design space. Each of the projects represents an in-depth exploration of a certain area of this design space. Within these areas, my work can be a very concrete guide about what is likely to work well and what is likely to be problematic. The presence or absence of a shared display for \emph{backchan.nl} is one easy example of this guidance. In contexts without a dedicated display, usage of \emph{backchan.nl} falls dramatically. Chapter \ref{ch:virtual} has a wide range of specific tradeoffs inherent to designing virtual interfaces that could provide a guide for designers in virtual worlds. The analysis of \emph{Tin Can} makes a point to show how tablets as a platform operate in a classroom in comparison to laptops. These sorts of findings serve as local directions on the map; areas near the implemented design that we have experimented with and found wanting in various ways.

It is worthwhile at the close of this thesis to return to our three major research themes and consider the lessons we can learn from this set of projects.

Using text-based communication channels to create a sense of grounding in \emph{backchan.nl} and \emph{Tin Can} had a mixed effect. In neither case did the system create a true sense of the side channel being an automatic component of common ground for people involved in the event; shared displays are no automatic route to group-level common ground. Of course, whether a bit of information is part of common ground or not is not a simple binary judgement. Across all the studies we saw varying extents to which people made assumptions about side stage information being mutually visible and understood by others. Situations with single shared displays like optimal \emph{backchan.nl} setups yielded the smoothest transitions between side stage and main stage, while synchronized but non-shared displays in \emph{Tin Can} supported transition, but it took somewhat more negotiation. In the virtual context, the challenge of attending to the side stage at all got in the way of any strong statements about the visualizations role in supporting group grounding.

Non-verbal actions play a critical role in essentially any design of a mediated communication system. All of the projects in this thesis show different ways of constructing those actions to different effects. Unsurprisingly, actions that are familiar to people because of their widespread use and offline analogs (like voting, which appears in \emph{backchan.nl} and \emph{Tin Can}) are the most successful. The more complex promotion mechanics in \emph{Tin Can} were also well understood, even though there are fewer comparable actions in other mediated experiences. In general, familiar mechanics are more quickly understood by users and more complex mechanics take a longer period to become well understood by the group. In both \emph{backchan.nl} and \emph{Tin Can} users tended to have a few hours to become acquainted with the outcome, visibility, and implications of their actions within the context of the system. Adding unfamiliar actions to a system has a similar legibility tradeoff to any UI decision; it imposes a learning cost on users with a potential payoff in enabling new sorts of interactions. These costs can be steeper in a social situation because it is not enough to know what your actions will mean to the system, you must also develop an appreciation for how your actions will be presented to others and understood by them. This is analogous to the mutual awareness challenge in grounding; fluency in the actions of a social system rests on mutual appreciation of the mechanical implications.

One of the main traditional critiques of backchannel systems had always been that they split the attention of the audience. In this argument, the backchannel is viewed as an audience-only distraction that is disrespectful to the presenter. All of the project in this thesis have pushed back on this notion, by demonstrating how shifting to a main stage and side stage model recognizes the possibility of fluid transfer of ideas between a text based side stage and a ``being there'' main stage. By creating side stages that are designed to influence the main stage in clear, well-defined ways, we can reconfigure the attention problem from being one where attention to anything other than the current speaker is conceived of as inattention to a situation where attention to the side stage is a different sort of attention that has benefits for the shared experience, broadly understood. In \emph{backchan.nl}, this is achieved by setting up an expectation that questions and comments should be shared through the system and would transition to the main stage at specific moments. In \emph{Tin Can}, the professor's presence in the side stage created a clear sense of it as part of the classroom space where students could try out speaking turns in a lower stakes environment but one that nonetheless would have an impact on the main stage if others liked their contribution. Thus by building stronger connections between the main and side stages, mediated systems like those I describe are not competing with traditional ``being there'' experiences, but are complementing them. 



% grounding - difficult to support, but a useful goal
% actions - critical to non-skeuemorphic social design
% attention - demonstrating situations where mediated tools aren't subtractive, they're addititive

% moving forward!



Not yet written! Will just summarize the major contributions in terms of stages, the three research themes (grounding, nonverbal actions, and attention), and point to future directions.
